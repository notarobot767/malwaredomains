# Malware Domains
Having a list of known malware domains allows us filter/block name resolutions to these sites. Using the Python3 [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-content), this script will pull and aggregate multiple souces of malware domain lists into format of your choosing. This is most useful for a Window [Hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) or Bind9 dns server because we can return a loopback address '127.0.0.1' or invalid address '0.0.0.0' instead of the malicious IP address.
